    "Compared to iteration, recursion is generally no faster, and often slower, and also carries more concerns over possible memory issues (e.g. stack overflow). It is mainly used where it is simpler or more elegant to code, clearer to understand, or is a more natural (easier) way to express the underlying math. There may be some very specific applications, using recursion optimized languages, that benefit from recursion over iteration, but I am still unsure if this is more just about easier conceptualization in some fields. <br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "This is because it executes in a non-intuitive way. Humans, generally, like to do iterative math, where each step produces an intermediate answer, or set of outputs, which can be used by the next step, until the final answer / output(s) is/are found. This function, however, creates a set of incomplete statements while also finding the $\\gcd$ by an iterative step-by-step process. In essence it is doing one iteration AND building the steps for a second set of iterations which use results from the previous round of iteration _in reverse order_. This reversal of direction, using results found on the way 'forward',  is known as 'back substition'.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Back substitution is not well represented by serial lines of code. It is hard for me to see a forward process as also building the structure of a backward process which will run when the forward process completes. The code simply doesn't spell this out for me in terms of its structure.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "OK, I now know _how_ the recursive version works. I also know that, generally, iterative versions are faster and more efficient, and less prone to memory trouble.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To create an iterative version of `egcd()`, I can start with my own code, `gcd()`. The latter function simply finds the greatest common divisor of two (non-zero) integers. Thus, it requires two integer parameters and returns one integer.<br>\n",
