# JupyterNotebooks

Learning to use Jupyter notebooks:

Current level of ability: Noob copy/paste exploration, with background of a bit of coding / environment setup experience.

Even though I'm far from an experienced user, so far I am totally blown away by the usefullness, flexibility, and creative potential of these notebooks.

Nice article (and discussion in comments section) of limits and crtiticisms of Jupyter notebboks: http://opiateforthemass.es/articles/why-i-dont-like-jupyter-fka-ipython-notebook/
